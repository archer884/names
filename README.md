# names

A command that prints random names.

## Choosing names is bad for you

Especially for secondary and tertiary characters! From now on, just print a half-dozen names to the console and pick one that feels good enough.

```shell
$ names surname 11
Dingle
Lansberry
Sainsbury
Welby
Allenson
Brigham
Minshew
Slay
Weekes
Lewing
Hillers
```

Prints male names, female names, and surnames. At the moment, we don't have that many male names. :(
